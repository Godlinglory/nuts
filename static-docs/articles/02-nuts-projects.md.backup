# Nuts projects
Nuts repository is composed of several projects that can be organized in 5 categories

* **Core Nuts** : These projects are the core/base of the nuts package manager
* **Companion Tools** : These projects are applications and tools to install with **Nuts** itself. Their installation are prompted at first install of **Nuts**
* **Toolbox** : These projects are applications and tools built on top of Nuts Application Framework of common interest
* **Lib** : These projects are common libraries that can be used to enabled some **Nuts** features in your application
* **Other** : All other apps that does no fit in the previous categories

## 1- Core Nuts projects
Core nuts projects include **nuts-builder**, **nuts-api**, **nuts-core**.
### 1.1 **nuts-builder**
**nuts-builder** is a meta project (parent maven pom project) that helps building all the other projects.

### 1.2 **nuts-api**
**nuts-api** is the effective "Nuts" only required dependency. It defines the bootstrap application that is responsible of loading all necessary libraries for its execution. **nuts-api** start to load **nuts-core** which is responsible of implementing all features and interfaces declared by the **nuts-api** library. That implementation will handle further download, version dependency etc. Such architecture is considered to force loose coupling with nuts binaries.
**nuts-api** is a very thin boostrapper : its size is about 300k. It can be used as a standalone application or as an embedded library.

### 1.3 **nuts-core**
**nuts-core** is the effective and standard implementation of **nuts-api**. **nuts-core** has a faster update pace than **nuts-api**. It focuses on performance an compliance to the **Nuts** specification declared by **nuts-api** interfaces. You are not required to add this dependency to your application if you want to embed **Nuts**. The library will be loaded on the wire (if not yet present in the classpath).

**nuts-core** is designed to have very few dependencies : **gson** and **jansi**. **gson** trivially is used to support json serialization : the main format used in **Nuts** to support configuration and descriptors. **jansi** is used to support terminal coloring and the "Nuts Text Coloring Format" (NTCF), a simple text format that helps creating colorful terminal applications.

## 2. Companion tools projects
Companion tools include **nadmin**, **nsh** and **ndi**.
These three applications are implemented following the "Nuts Application Framework" and hence are dependent on **nuts-api** library. They are recommended applications to install with **Nuts** itself, however they are not mandatory and may be ignored particularly when using **nuts-api** as library.

### 2.1 **nadmin**
**nadmin** (for nuts admin)is an administration tool to the **Nuts** workspaces. It adds support to manage users, credentials, authorizations, workspaces and repositories by providing command line support for such actions.

### 2.2 **nsh**
**nsh** (for nuts shell) is simply a portable POSIX bash compatible implementation. It supports all common builtin commands (ls, cd, rm, ...) and adds support to grep, ssh and scp in a seamless manner. It also supports command line, scripts (including commons constructs with if, do, case, ...) and pipes (|)

### 2.3 **ndi**
**ndi** (for nuts desktop integration)is simply a helper tool to support seamless integration of nuts commands in your favorite operating system and environment. **ndi** is responsible of creating script shortcuts to your common commands so that you can invoke tem directly from your environment. For instance it creates an "nadmin" script and configures your PATH environment to help calling the nuts admin tool instead of the common way to do so "nuts nadmin". On window system, **ndi** will create shortcuts and menus.


## 3. Toolbox projects
**Nuts** come with an array of tools out of the box you can install and play with. Here are these tools

### 3.1 **nded**
**nded** for "Nuts Descriptor Editor" is a small tool for creating and editing json Nuts descriptor file. It is intended to be called by automation tools.

### 3.2 **nclown**
**nclown** is an angular web application frontend for **Nuts**. It helps navigating, searching and installing artifacts. It is intended to be a web admin tool as well.

### 3.3 **nserver**
**nserver** is a standalone application that runs a small http server that will expose a workspace as a remote repository to other **Nuts** installations. This is the simplest way to mirror a workspace and share artifacts between networked nodes.

### 3.4 **nwar**
**nwar** (for Nuts Web Application Archive)is a web application that exposes **nserver** as a war to be deployed on a more mature http server or container.

### 3.5 **ndexer**
**ndexer** (for Indexer)is a lucene powered index for Nuts. It can be shared across multiple **Nuts** workspaces and processes.

### 3.6 **feenoo**
**feenoo** is a small search tool. It searches for files, files contents and classes within jars. You ca search for files than contains some text or jars that contain some class, or jars of a specific version of java.
The name **feenoo** comes form the Tunisian dialect and means "where is it?".

### 3.7 **file-version**
**file-version** is a small tool that helps detecting files versions. It supports jar, war, ear, dll and exe file versions. It opens a file and looks for it's version in it meta-data.

### 3.8 **nmysql**
**nmysql** is a companion tool to the mysql and mariadb servers. The initial actions supported are backup and restore including push/pull mechanism from/to a couple of databases for synchronization. It supports jdbc and ssh based access to remote mysql/mariadb installation.

### 3.9 **ntomcat**
**ntomcat** is a companion tool to the tomcat http server. The initial actions supported are start, stop, status, configure (http ports etc..) and deploy. It supports as well installation of several version of Tomcat and multi domain configuration for deployments.

### 3.10 **nderby**
**nderby** is a companion tool to the derby database server. The initial actions supported are start, stop, status and configure. It supports as well installation of several version of Derby.

### 3.11 **nmvn**
**nmvn** is a companion tool to maven. It supports installations of several versions of it and running them seamlessly.

### 3.12 **worky**
**worky** is a developer centered tool. The 'y' in **worky** refers to 'my' in the "Tunisian Dialect" and hence means "my work". **Worky** is the tool we - maven users - need to check if the version of project we are working on is yet to be deployed to nexus or not. So basically it checks if the version is the same, and downloads the server's version and then compares binaries to local project's to check if we have missed to update the version in our pom.xml. I know I'm not the only one having pain with jar deployments to nexus. **Worky** does other things as well to help me on on daily basis.

## 4. Library Projects
Library projects are several libraries that add **Nuts** support in a particular environment or domain.
### 4.1 **nuts-tomcat-classloader**
This is a must-have feature in your web application if deployed on Tomcat. It solves the following problem : a simple war application is surprisingly fat with too many jars (hundreds of Megas) you need to upload each time you change a single file or class in your web project. Basically all the jar included in the lib folder of the war are to be uploaded each time to the remote Tomcat server. The common solution is to use "provided" scope in maven and put your jars in Tomcat lib or ext folders. This is a bad approach if you are using a single Tomcat process for multiple applications. **nuts-tomcat-classloader** simply uses nuts to download libraries when the application is deployed based on the **pom.xml** you provide and include them in the current web application class loader. Hence, the war becomes lighter than ever. **Nuts** cache mechanisms optimizes bandwidth and makes this more convenient by sharing the same jar files between applications depending on the same versions. 
All you have to do is to add this library to you application and configure your **pom.xml** accordingly.


### 4.2 **nuts-servlet**
Basically this is the simplest way to include **nserver** into your web application.

### 4.3 **nuts-lib-template**
This library provides helper methods to manipulate maven pom.xml and generate simple Java files while supporting Nuts concepts. It is used in other tools that are meant to generate maven projects.

## 5. Other Projects
Other projects you may encounter in the repository are WIP projects that may be continued or discontinued.
This includes : **nutsc** (a native c bootstrapper) and **nuts-installer** (a nuts installer tool)

## 6. Honorable mentions
