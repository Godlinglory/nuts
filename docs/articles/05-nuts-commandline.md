# Nuts Commandline
**Nuts** supports a specific format for command line arguments. This format is the format supported in Nuts Application Framewok (NAF) and as such all NAF applications support the same command line arguments format.
Arguments in **Nuts** can be options or non options. Options always start with dash (-). 

## Short vs Long Options
Options can be long options (starts with double dash) or short options (start with a single dash). 
Many arguments support both forms. For instance "-w" and "--workspace" are the spported forms to define the workspace location in the nuts command.

## Option Values
Options can also support a value of type string or boolean.  The value can be suffixed to the option while separated with '=' sign or immediately after the option. As an example "-w=/myfolder/myworkspace" and  "--workspace /myfolder/myworkspace" are equivalent.

## Boolean Options
Particularly, when the value is a boolean, the value do not need to be defined. As a result "--skip-companions" and "--skip-companions=true" are equivalent. However "--skip-companions true" is not (because the option is of type boolean) and "true" will be parsed as a NonOption.

To define a "false" value to the boolean option we can either suffix with "=false" or prefix with "!" or "~" sign. 
Hence, "--skip-companions=false", "--!skip-companions" and "--~skip-companions" are all equivalent.

## Combo Simple Options
Simple options can be grouped in a single word. "-ls" is equivalent to "-l -s". So one should be careful. 
One exception though. For portability reasons, "-version" is considered a single short option.

## Ignoring Options, Comments
Options starting with "-//" and "--//" are simply ignored by the command line parser.

## Nuts Option Types

Options in Nuts are regrouped in multiple categories. An option can belong to multiple categories though.

* Create Options : such options are only relevant when creating a new workspace. They define the configuration of the workspace to create. They will be ignored when the workspace already exists. Examples include
    * --skip-companions
    * --archetype
    * --store-strategy
    * --standalone

* Open Options : such options are relevant when creating a new workspace or when opening an existing workspace. They define the way commands are executed. Examples include
    * --workspace
    * --bot
    * --reset

* Exported Options : are passed to sub-**nuts**-processes that will be created by **nuts**. For instance when nuts will call the **nsh** command it will spawn a new process. In such case, these options are passed to the sub-process as environment variable.
    * --workspace
    * --bot
    * --no-color

* Application Options : are options that are by default supported by Applications using NAF (Nuts Application Framework) (as well as Nuts it self).
    * --help
    * --version

all nuts options are described in the command help. Just type :
```
nuts --help
```
