# nuts 0.5.6.0
Network Updatable Things Services

# Install Notes
To do a fresh install of nuts (if you do not have any previous version or config installed), just download nuts from and run

```
java -jar nuts-0.5.7.jar
```
After doing this, on linux platforms, you should be able to invoke nuts simply by using the 'nuts' command 
(actually installed by ndi at nuts installation time)

The verify nuts installation just type :
```
nuts version
```
you should see something like
```
0.5.7/0.5.7.0
```

# Troubleshooting
Whenever installation of running fails, it is more likely there is a mis-configuration or invalid libraries that are used. 
see [troubleshooting documentation](../troubleshooting.md) for more details


# Update from Previous versions Notes
## Update from 0.5.6
just issue :  
```
nuts update --all
```


## Update from 0.5.5 or previous  
version 0.5.6 introduces consequent architecture and config updates such as XDG Base Directory Specification and 
simpler (cache enabled) repositories layout. You wont be able to import older versions config.
Configuration files have moved from ~/.nuts to ~/.config/nuts.
