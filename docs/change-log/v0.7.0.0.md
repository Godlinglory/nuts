# nuts 0.6.0.0
Network Updatable Things Services

# Install Notes
To do a fresh install of nuts (if you do not have any previous version or config installed), just download nuts from and run

```
java -jar nuts-0.7.0.jar
```
After doing this, on linux platforms, you should be able to invoke nuts simply by using the 'nuts' command 
(actually installed by ndi at nuts installation time)

The verify nuts installation just type :
```
nuts version
```
you should see something like
```
0.7.0/0.7.0.0
```

Note that it is strongly **recommended** to do a fresh install because this version is breaking with previous configuration files. 
You may want to use the zero flag (-z) to import older configuration files.

```
java -jar nuts-0.7.0.jar -z -y
```

Note also that upgrading to this version may make 0.5 versions unusable for the co-located workspaces.

# Troubleshooting
Whenever installation of running fails, it is more likely there is a mis-configuration or invalid libraries that are used. 
see [troubleshooting documentation](../troubleshooting.md) for more details


# Update from Previous versions Notes
just issue :  
```
nuts update --all
```

# Update from Previous versions Notes
If previous version fails to update you can always do a forced update using the latest version :  
```
java -jar nuts-0.7.0.jar -z -y
```
