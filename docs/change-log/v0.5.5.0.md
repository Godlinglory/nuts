# Install Notes
To do a fresh install of nuts (il you do not have any previous version or config installed), just download nuts from and run
java -jar nuts-0.5.5.jar

If you dont know if uts is already installed, it is safer to run the following command :
java -jar nuts-0.5.5.jar --recover -y install -c

# Update from Previous versions Notes
version 0.5.5 introduces consequent architecture and config updates such a new and more robust security agent, application metadata and some configuration file format changes. 
You need to invoke recover mode to update config as well. Here after steps to update from previous version 0.5.4
//invoke update
>java -jar ~/bin/nuts-0.5.4.jar update
// you should see something like this
Workspace has 2 components to update.
0.5.4    : net.vpc.app.nuts:nuts      => 0.5.5
0.5.4.0  : net.vpc.app.nuts:nuts-core => 0.5.5.0

// run new nuts 
nuts --recover -y install -c

if the command is not recognized (mainly because old version may have installation issues) download new version from and run 
java -jar nuts-0.5.5.jar --recover -y install -c
