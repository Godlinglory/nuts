/**
 * ====================================================================
 * Nuts : Network Updatable Things Service
 * (universal package manager)
 * <br>
 * is a new Open Source Package Manager to help install packages and libraries
 * for runtime execution. Nuts is the ultimate companion for maven (and other
 * build managers) as it helps installing all package dependencies at runtime.
 * Nuts is not tied to java and is a good choice to share shell scripts and
 * other 'things' . Its based on an extensible architecture to help supporting a
 * large range of sub managers / repositories.

/**
 * Nuts descriptors define an <strong>immutable</strong> image to all information needed to execute an artifact.
 * It resembles to maven's pom file but it focuses on execution information
 * rather then build information. Common features are inheritance
 * dependencies, standard dependencies, exclusions and properties.
 * However nuts descriptor adds new features such as :
 * <ul>
 *     <li>multiple parent inheritance</li>
 *     <li>executable/nuts-executable flag</li>
 *     <li>environment (arch, os, dist,platform) filters</li>
 *     <li>classifiers may be mapped to environment (think of dlls for windows and so for linux)</li>
 * </ul>
 * A versatile way to change descriptor is to use builder ({@link #builder()}).
