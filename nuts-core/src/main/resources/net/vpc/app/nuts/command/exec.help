==nuts==  [[exec]] \[-options\]... \[command\] {{\<args\>}}...
 [[--exec]] \[-options\]... \[command\] {{\<args\>}}...
 [[-e]] \[-options\]... \[command\] {{\<arguments\>}}...
      runs command with the given executor options \( it will be considered an option if it 
      starts with '-' \). This is helpful to issue JVM Options to executor for instance

@@OPTIONS:@@
 [[--embedded]]  or [[-b]]
      when invoking a nuts component, it will be executed in the current process (no JVM process wil be spawn)

 [[--external]]  or [[--spawn]] or [[-x]]
      when invoking a nuts component, it will alway be executed in a newly created process (this is the default)

 [[--native]]  or [[--syscall]] or [[-n]]
      the command is considered as a native command (not a nuts) and will be passed to the os as is.

@@EXAMPLES:@@
        ==nuts== exec [[--help]]
            shows this help and exit
       
        ==nuts== exec [[--yes]] [[-e]] {{-Xmx1G}} netbeans-launcher
            runs netbeans-launcher with JVM option  {{-Xmx1G}}. If the component is not installed
            it will be automatically installed ( [[--yes]] modifier helps bypassing interactive mode)

        ==nuts== ##exec## my-nuts-group:my-nuts#12.3
           executes the version 12.3 of my-nuts-group:my-nuts

        ==nuts== ##exec## my-nuts-group:my-nuts
           executes the latest version of my-nuts-group:my-nuts


        ==nuts== ##exec## my-nuts
           executes the latest version of my-nuts-group:my-nuts
                supposing that my-nuts-group is added as imported group using
                config import my-nuts-group
