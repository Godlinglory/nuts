nuts stands for **Network Updatable Things Services** tool. It is a simple tool  for managing remote
components, installing these  components to the current machine and executing such  components on need.
Each managed package  is also called a **nuts** which  is a **Network Updatable Thing Service** .
Nuts components are  stored  into repositories. A  *repository*  may be local for  storing local Nuts
or remote for accessing  remote components (good examples  are  remote maven  repositories). It may
also be a proxy repository so that remote components are fetched and cached locally to save network
resources.
One manages a set of repositories called a  workspace. Managed **nuts**  (components)  have descriptors
that depicts dependencies between them. This dependency is seamlessly handled by  **nuts**  (tool) to
resolve and download on-need dependencies over the wire.

**nuts** is a swiss army knife tool as it acts like (and supports) *maven* build tool to have an abstract
view of the the  components dependency and like  *npm*, **pip** or *zypper/apt-get*  package manager tools  
to  install and uninstall components allowing multiple versions of the very same component to  be installed.

## COMMON VERBS:
+ deploy,undeploy   : handle components (package installers) on the local repositories
+ install,uninstall : install/uninstall a package (using its fetched/deployed installer)
+ update            : update a package (using its fetched/deployed installer)
+ fetch,push        : download, upload to remote repositories
+ find              : searches for existing/installable components
