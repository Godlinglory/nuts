<div>
    <span class="nuts">nuts</span>, aka Network Updatable Things Services, is a Javaâ„¢ Package Manager that helps
    discovering, downloading, assembling and executing local and remote artifacts (packages) in a very handy way.
</div>


<div>
    Unlike maven which resolves dependencies at compile time, <span class="nuts">nuts</span> solves dependencies and
    builds
    the classpath at install time and, as a result, saves disk and bandwidth by downloading and caching only libraries
    required for the current environment and share them between multiple installed applications.
</div>

<div>
    <span class="nuts">nuts</span> is unique in that it reuses maven and other build tool descriptor formats to solve dependency graph, and does not, whatsoever, have any requirement on existing maven created packages.
</div>
<div>
    <span class="nuts">nuts</span> is the ultimate solution to get rid of the ugly lib jars, fat-jars, uber-jars and
    one-jars used for deploying java applications.
